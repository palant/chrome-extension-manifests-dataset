Feel free to request new features in the issues tab above or join our discord (https://discord.gg/s6hhmgWmsG) to discuss bugs or upcoming features.\n\nBadge approvals & notifications\nThis tool allows members to easily request badges they've earnt but haven't yet recieved without confronting email. Simply enter your name, badge and level and a pre-made email will be sent off to your leader for review. This tool will also update logs in a google sheet to easily see which scouts are still waiting for their badge. \n\nGroup badge summaries\nWant to see all the badges someone has earned without having to click through 10 different pages? Scrap that. Want to see every badge that everyone has completed on one, printable report? Your wish is my command. Head over to the \"Group Life\" page. Select your unit, then hit the \"Generate Report\" button below the table. \n\nCopy & Paste Logbook entries\nIf you have lots of similar log entries, or want to copy the same log entry to multiple youth members you can use this tool to copy and paste them! Find or create a log entry and go to it's \"View Record\" page. Click the new Copy to Clipboard button and then go back to the main log book page and click paste, it is that easy! You can also copy from one profile and login as another and the paste still works.  \n\nExport events to your own calendar\nSick of adding events in Terrain and also your own calendar. Use the shiny new button contained in a planned activity and you will recieve a ical file ready to be imported into whichever calendar application you use."
