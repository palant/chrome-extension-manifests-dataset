OIB is personal identification number used in Croatia. If you are outside of Croatia it is unlikelly that this will be of much use to you.\n\nUsage instructions\nInstall the extension and right Click on any input field in which you would like to insert new OIB. Menu item \"Generate OIB\" will be shown and upon clicking it, new OIB will be generated and inserted into the field.\n\nHow does it work\nOIBs are generated by first generating 10 random digits and then calculating the final, 11th, control digit that is used to validate the OIB. The last digit is generated from first 10 digit using the ISO7064 (MOD 11,10) specification.\n\nThis extension just generates OIBs that pass the OIB validations. It does not generate actual OIBs used by the citizens and companies of Croatia. OIBs generated with this extension should not be used in production environments."
