You might be wondering why this matters or why we made this decision when other well-known companies have chosen to plant new ones. To put it simply, compelling studies show that planting trees won’t be enough to tackle climate change and that efforts on rainforest conservation lead to a more sustainable and lasting change.\n\n🌎 How it helps\nUsing the OpenTabs new tab homepage search bar for your internet searches, enables you to automatically support a global community of people working hard to conserve and restore the Earth's forests.\n\n⚙️Settings and Features\n• Fast search results\n• Beautiful backgrounds\n• Trees saved counter\n• List of your favorite websites\n• Interesting search suggestions\n• Affiliate disclosure popup on website bookmarks\n\n📋 Terms\nBy clicking \"add to Chrome\", I accept and agree to installing the OpenTabs Search extension and setting the Chrome New Tab search provider as described by the services in Terms of Use https://www.opentabs.org/terms/ and Privacy Policy https://www.opentabs.org/privacy/."
