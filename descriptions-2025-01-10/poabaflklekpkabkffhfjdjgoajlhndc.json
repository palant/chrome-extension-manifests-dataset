More stocking stuffers? More presents? We are too! \nSo we created XmasBlocker. A simple web extension that will block all unwanted Holiday and Christmas ads for you - so you don't need to see them anymore.\n\nHOW DOES IT WORK?\nDownload the extension and select if you want to block images, text, or both. \nThen decide if you want to blur the content or remove them altogether. \nAnd voila - the extension will do its magic. \n\nHopefully, this will make browsing the internet a bit easier for you this Holiday season.\n\nMade with ❤️ by those who love the holidays - but not all the commercial ads around it. \n\nGOT FEEDBACK? We'd love to hear it! \nGive us feedback if you like our extension OR if you'd like to add other content filters!"
