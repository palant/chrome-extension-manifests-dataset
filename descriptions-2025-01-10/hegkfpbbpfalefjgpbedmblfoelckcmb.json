However, these pure nature sounds are increasingly scarce as we humans continue to destroy the natural ecosystems which produce them. \n\n🐞 That’s where earth.fm and you come in: as well as sharing new nature sounds every day, we’re actively helping the community to go out in nature more often and discover a deeper, more direct connection with the wonders around us, which can lead to more well being on individual and collective levels.\n\n👂 And when you close the computer, keep your ears open and go outside. The best experience of nature sounds is in nature!\n\nHugs\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWebsite: https://earth.fm/\nOur blog: https://earth.fm/blog/\nOur podcast: https://earth.fm/podcast/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/earthfm_live/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/earth_fm_live\nSay hi: hello@earth.fm"
