With our 100% privacy-safe extension, you can enjoy peace of mind, knowing your information is in good hands. 🛡️\n\nThe permission requested on Google Chrome during the installation of Weka is misleading, and far from the needs of the extension. Explanation: Read your browsing history: Required to detect whether an active WhatsApp session exists among the tabs you are browsing for one click to open chat in the reminder window. This is the \"tab\" permission from the Chrome Developer Guide, which DOES NOT allow the extension to read your browsing history. It only allows the extension to know what tabs are open right now.\n\nLEGAL \n────────────────────────────────────        \nWhatsApp is a trademark of WhatsApp Inc., registered in the U.S. and other countries. Weka is an independent product and has no relationship to WhatsApp, WhatsApp Inc, or Facebook Inc.
