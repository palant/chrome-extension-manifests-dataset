You’ve probably been wondering how to flip the screen to watch your favorite series comfortably in bed. We got you, here’s an extension you need!\n\nWith Paramount+ Video Bender you’re able to rotate the screen at different angles and zoom the video in or out, all to achieve the perfect sync with your go-to watching position. You don’t need to worry about stabilizing your device since the only thing being flipped is the video. \n\nExtension scales the video to fit its width or height and rotates the screen every 45 degrees, so it allows you to choose the video position starting from fully horizontal or vertical, through diagonal, up to upside down! \n\nAll you need to do is add Paramount+ Video Bender extension to your browser, manage available options in the control panel and adjust the video size and angle as you wish. It’s as simple as that!\n\nDisclaimer : Paramount+ is a trademark of ViacomCBS Streaming. This website & extension hold no association or affiliation with Paramount+ or any third-party companies."
