Blocca tutti i siti Web di time-westing per mantenerti produttivo e lontano da tutte le distrazioni che Internet ha da offrire.\n\nPer utilizzare Blocca sito, è sufficiente impostare una password, decidere a quali siti Web si desidera accedere e consentire a Site Blocker di bloccare il resto. Se vuoi visitare un sito che hai bloccato, inserisci la tua password e decidi per quanto tempo vuoi rimanere sul sito bloccato.\n\nSe sei un genitore, puoi impostare la password per il bambino. Oppure, se desideri usarlo per te stesso, chiedi a un amico o un partner di impostarlo per aiutarti a impegnarti.\n\nE voilà! Ora disponi di una serie di guardrail Internet che ti aiutano a rimanere produttivo e concentrato sia che tu stia studiando, imparando a distanza o hai bisogno di un ulteriore potenziamento dell'autocontrollo per completare un progetto.\n\n⭐️Caratteristiche⭐️\n\n👉 Blocca i siti inclusi i relativi sottodomini\nRimuovi dalla tua vita tutti i siti Web che distraggono e dannosi bloccandoli per te mentre devi rimanere concentrato e produttivo.\n\n👉 Lista bianca\nAggiungi eccezioni all'elenco dei siti Web bloccati. I siti di questo elenco evitano tutte le impostazioni di blocco.\n\n👉 Modalità messa a fuoco\nLa funzione del timer della modalità di messa a fuoco ti consente di controllare il tuo programma tramite il timer della tecnica del pomodoro. Suddividi le tue attività in intervalli seguiti da una breve pausa. Con la \"Modalità messa a fuoco\" puoi impostare gli orari in cui disabilitare i siti Web e quando navigare liberamente, senza bisogno di forza di volontà.\n\n👉Gestione del tempo\nMostra quanti cicli di lavoro hai completato durante una sessione. Sarai in grado di portare a termine tutte le tue attività e avrai ancora tempo per navigare tra i tuoi siti e app preferiti.\n\n👉 Protezione con password\nSe avvii la modalità focus puoi fermarla con un passcode a tua scelta, rendendo un po' più difficile procrastinare. Puoi anche proteggere con password la pagina delle opzioni per impedirti di rimuovere facilmente i siti dal tuo elenco.\n\n👉 Modalità di messa a fuoco inarrestabile\nSeleziona l'opzione per nascondere i pulsanti di pausa e interruzione nelle impostazioni dell'estensione. E non sarai in grado di interrompere il blocco dei siti fino alla scadenza del tempo di blocco.\n\n👉 Pagina bloccata divertente\nOra vedrai immagini divertenti se stai tentando di entrare in un sito bloccato. Per fare ciò, è necessario abilitare questa opzione nelle impostazioni di blocco del sito. Non sarai ancora in grado di entrare nel sito bloccato, ma forse una foto divertente ti farà sorridere :))\n\nBlock Site è uno dei migliori strumenti di produttività disponibili per aiutare le persone a procrastinare meno, diventare più produttive e raggiungere i propri obiettivi di vita. Non dovrai mai più preoccuparti di come rimanere concentrato sul lavoro. Allora, cosa stai aspettando? Scarica ora e inizia a prendere il controllo del tuo tempo... oggi!\n\n*Nota*\nPer bloccare i siti in modalità di navigazione in incognito è necessario attivare la casella di controllo \"Consenti esecuzione in modalità di navigazione in incognito\" nella pagina chrome://extensions.",

Eller, om du vill använda det själv, låt en vän eller partner ställa in det åt dig för att hjälpa dig att engagera dig.\n\nOch voila! Du har nu en uppsättning internetskyddsräcken som hjälper dig att hålla dig produktiv och på jobbet oavsett om du studerar, distansutbildning eller behöver en extra boost självkontroll för att avsluta ett projekt.\n\n⭐️Funktioner⭐️\n\n👉 Blockera webbplatser inklusive dess underdomäner\nTa bort alla distraherande och skadliga webbplatser från ditt liv genom att blockera dem åt dig medan du behöver vara fokuserad och produktiv.\n\n👉 Vit lista\nLägg till undantag i listan över blockerade webbplatser. Webbplatser från den här listan undviker alla blockeringsinställningar.\n\n👉 Fokusläge\nFokuslägestimerfunktionen gör att du kan styra ditt schema via Pomodoro-tekniktimern. Dela upp dina uppgifter i intervaller följt av en kort paus. Med \"Fokusläge\" kan du ställa in tider när du ska inaktivera webbplatser och när du ska surfa fritt - ingen viljestyrka behövs.\n\n👉 Tidshantering\nVisa hur många arbetscykler du genomförde under ett pass. Du kommer att kunna få alla dina uppgifter gjorda och fortfarande ha tid att bläddra mellan dina favoritwebbplatser och appar.\n\n👉 Lösenordsskydd\nOm du startar fokusläget kan du stoppa det med ett lösenord som du väljer, vilket gör det lite svårare att skjuta upp. Du kan också lösenordsskydda alternativsidan för att hindra dig från att enkelt ta bort webbplatser från din lista.\n\n👉 Ostoppbart fokusläge\nVälj alternativet för att dölja paus- och stoppknapparna i tilläggsinställningarna. Och du kommer inte att kunna sluta blockera webbplatser förrän blockeringstiden går ut.\n\n👉 Rolig blockerad sida\nDu kommer nu att se roliga bilder om du försöker komma in på en blockerad sida. För att göra detta måste du aktivera det här alternativet i inställningarna för webbplatsblockering. Du kommer fortfarande inte att kunna komma in på den blockerade sidan, men kanske en rolig bild får dig att le :))\n\nBlock Site är ett av de bästa produktivitetsverktygen som finns för att hjälpa människor att skjuta upp mindre, bli mer produktiva och nå sina livsmål. Du behöver aldrig mer oroa dig för hur du ska hålla fokus på jobbet. Så vad väntar du på? Ladda ner nu och börja ta kontroll över din tid...idag!\n\n*Notera*\nFör att blockera webbplatser i inkognitoläge måste du aktivera kryssrutan \"Tillåt körning i inkognitoläge\" på chrome://extensions-sidan.",

    "tr": "Çevrimiçi gezinmek için biraz zaman istiyorsanız, ancak tamamen gelişmiş bir internet sarmalından kaçınmayı umuyorsanız, site engelleyici sizin için mükemmel olabilir.\n\nDikkat dağıtan siteler için bir zaman sınırı belirleyin. Sınıra ulaştığınızda, bir blok devreye girer. Bu, beslemenizi ara sıra kontrol edebileceğiniz anlamına gelir, ancak çok uzun süre veya çok sık değil.\n\nÇalışmanıza, öğrenmenize ve önemli olan işinize odaklanmanıza yardımcı olmak için tasarlanmış site engelleyici. Sizi üretken kılmak ve internetin sunduğu tüm dikkat dağıtıcı şeylerden uzak tutmak için zaman harcayan tüm web sitelerini engeller.\n\nSiteyi engelle'yi kullanmak için, sadece bir şifre belirleyin, hangi web sitelerine erişmek istediğinize karar verin ve site engelleyicinin geri kalanını engellemesine izin verin. Engellediğiniz bir siteyi ziyaret etmek istiyorsanız, sadece şifrenizi girin ve engellenen sitede ne kadar süre kalmak istediğinize karar verin.\n\nEbeveyn iseniz, çocuk için şifre belirleyebilirsiniz. Veya kendiniz için kullanmak isterseniz, taahhütte bulunmanıza yardımcı olması için bir arkadaşınızın veya partnerinizin sizin için ayarlamasını sağlayın.\n\nVe işte! Artık ister ders çalışıyor, ister uzaktan eğitim alıyor olun, ister bir projeyi bitirmek için ekstra özdenetime ihtiyacınız olsun, üretken ve görev başında kalmanıza yardımcı olacak bir dizi internet korkuluğuna sahipsiniz.\n\n⭐️Özellikler⭐️\n\n👉 Alt alan adları da dahil olmak üzere siteleri engelleyin\nOdaklanmış ve üretken kalmanız gerekirken tüm dikkat dağıtıcı ve zararlı web sitelerini sizin yerinize engelleyerek hayatınızdan çıkarın.\n\n👉 Beyaz liste\nEngellenen web siteleri listesine istisnalar ekleyin. Bu listedeki siteler, tüm engelleme ayarlarından kaçınır.\n\n👉 Odak Modu\nOdak modu zamanlayıcı özelliği, programınızı Pomodoro teknik zamanlayıcı aracılığıyla kontrol etmenizi sağlar. Görevlerinizi aralıklara bölün ve ardından kısa bir ara verin. \"Odak Modu\" ile web sitelerinin ne zaman devre dışı bırakılacağını ve ne zaman özgürce gezinileceğini ayarlayabilirsiniz - iradeye gerek yoktur.\n\n👉 Zaman Yönetimi\nBir oturum sırasında kaç çalışma döngüsünü tamamladığınızı gösterin. Tüm görevlerinizi tamamlayabileceksiniz ve aralarında en sevdiğiniz sitelere ve uygulamalara göz atmak için hala zamanınız olacak.\n\n👉 Şifre Koruması\nOdak modunu başlatırsanız, seçtiğiniz bir şifreyle durdurabilir ve ertelemeyi biraz daha zorlaştırabilirsiniz. Ayrıca, siteleri listenizden kolayca çıkarmanızı engellemek için seçenekler sayfasını parola ile koruyabilirsiniz.\n\n👉 Durdurulamaz Odaklanma Modu\nUzantı ayarlarında duraklatma ve durdurma düğmelerini gizleme seçeneğini seçin. Ve engelleme süresi sona erene kadar siteleri engellemeyi durduramayacaksınız.\n\n👉 Komik Engellenen Sayfa\nEngellenen bir siteye girmeye çalışıyorsanız artık komik resimler göreceksiniz. Bunu yapmak için, site engelleme ayarlarında bu seçeneği etkinleştirmeniz gerekir. Engellenen siteye yine giremeyeceksiniz ama belki komik bir resim yüzünüzü güldürür :))\n\nBlock Site, insanların işleri daha az ertelemesine, daha üretken olmasına ve yaşam hedeflerine ulaşmasına yardımcı olan en iyi üretkenlik araçlarından biridir.
