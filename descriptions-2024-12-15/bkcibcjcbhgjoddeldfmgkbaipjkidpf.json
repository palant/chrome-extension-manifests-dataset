Get all features for each account\n\n🔜 Profile enrichment\n\n🔜 Triggers based on event, for example when a prospect is tagged, a conversation archived and so on, prospect information is automatically synchronized with your CRM\n\n🔜 Track the click on the links sent\n\n🔜 ProspectIn synchronization\n\n📋 How do we manage your data?\n\nWe do not store any data as we retrieve the messages in real time from LinkedIn messaging. \n\nPiwaa behaves exactly like the standard LinkedIn messaging, the difference is in the interface and additional functionality that does not generate suspicious behavior with LinkedIn."
