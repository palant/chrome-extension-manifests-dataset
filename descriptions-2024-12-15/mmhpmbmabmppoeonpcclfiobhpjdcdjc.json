Among the most utilized are screenshot, screen capture, and screen recorder tools. Whether you're trying to capture a fleeting moment on your desktop or aiming to produce an instructional video, understanding the distinctions and applications of these tools is crucial.\n\nTaking a Screenshot\n\nA screenshot is a static image capture of what is displayed on your screen at any given moment. It’s like taking a photo of your screen. Whether you're using a Mac or a Windows computer, taking a screenshot is a breeze. If you ever wonder how to take a screenshot, especially on a screenshot Mac, you simply press Shift + Command + 4. This allows you to drag and select a portion of your screen for capture. \n\nOn the other hand, other platforms might have slightly different methods, but the essence of a screenshot remains consistent - a snapshot of your current screen. \n\nScreen Capture: Beyond Static Images\n\nWhen people refer to screen capture, they often mean the same thing as taking a screenshot. However, in a broader sense, screen capture can also refer to the recording of screen activities. This is where the screen recorder and screen video recorder functionalities come into play.\n\nThe Screen Recorder and Screen Video Recorder\n\nWhile a screenshot captures a still image of your screen, a screen recorder or screen video recorder captures video footage of the activities on your screen. This is particularly useful for creating tutorials, webinars, or even recording gameplay. \n\nA screen video recorder often comes with added functionalities such as the option to incorporate voiceovers or annotate in real-time. This allows for a more interactive and educational experience for the viewer. The output is a video file, as opposed to the static image format of a screenshot.\n\nHow to Take a Screenshot and More on a Mac\n\nFor Mac users who often wonder not just about how to take a screenshot but also about recording their screen, the MacOS offers built-in tools. As previously mentioned, for a screenshot Mac users can use the Shift + Command + 4 combination. But for those looking to utilize a screen video recorder, QuickTime Player is a great native application that offers both screen recording and screen video recording functionalities.\n\nIn conclusion, whether you're looking to capture a moment in time with a screenshot or wanting to produce a comprehensive tutorial with a screen video recorder, the options available today are vast and varied. The digital age offers tools for every need, and with a bit of practice, mastering the art of capturing your screen, be it through a simple screenshot or a screen video recording, becomes second nature.\n\nIn today's digital age, tools that assist in documenting our screen's content have become indispensable. The fundamental process begins with a screenshot or screen capture, a still image of what is displayed on your computer or device at any given moment. Whether you're looking to grab an entire window with full screen capture or aiming for just a portion with partial screen capture, the technology offers versatility. \n\nScreenshot, Screen capture, Screen recorder, Screen video recorder, How to take screenshot, Screenshot Mac, Screen grab, Desktop recording, Video capture software, Snapshot tool, Screen clipping, Full screen capture, Partial screen capture, Active window screenshot, Mobile screen recording, Live streaming software, Screen annotation, Interactive screencasting, Multi-monitor capture, Screen broadcast, Desktop screenshot utility, GIF screen recording, Instant screen capture, High-resolution screen recording, Overlay recording, Screen recording with audio.\n\nFor users specifically on Apple devices, the question of how to take a screenshot arises frequently. But worry not, Screenshot Mac procedures are straightforward and user-friendly. With just a few key combinations, you can grab an active window screenshot or even a specific segment of your screen, often referred to as screen clipping. The result of these actions is typically saved as an image, but tools like desktop screenshot utility or snapshot tool can help manage and edit these captures further.\n\nHowever, the realm of documenting screen activities isn't limited to static images. Enter the dynamic world of screen recorder and screen video recorder tools. Unlike a simple screen grab, a screen recorder documents motion, allowing for the creation of videos of whatever is happening on your desktop—a handy tool for making tutorials or recording gameplay.\n\nHighly specialized tools like video capture software further augment the recording process. For those who wish to record in motion format, GIF screen recording offers a fun and engaging way to capture screen activities. Moreover, for professionals who demand clarity, high-resolution screen recording ensures every detail is captured with utmost precision.\n\nAs technology evolves, the need to record across multiple screens has given rise to multi-monitor capture tools. Simultaneously, mobile screen recording caters to our ever-growing reliance on smartphones and tablets.\n\nBut what if you wish to guide your audience interactively? That's where interactive screencasting comes into play, allowing creators to engage with their viewers actively. For annotations and explanations, screen annotation tools offer functionalities like drawing, highlighting, and adding text directly to your captures or recordings.\n\nBest screenshot extension for Chrome, Free screenshot tools for browsers, How to use ScreenCapture, Full page screenshot extension, Screenshot extension with editing features, Screenshot extension reviews, Screenshot extensions for Firefox/Edge/Safari, Screen capture tools with cloud storage, Annotate screenshots browser extension, Quick screenshot extensions for web developers\n\nThe broadcasting arena has also seen advancements with screen broadcast features, supported by live streaming software.

Como se mencionó anteriormente, para hacer una captura de pantalla los usuarios de Mac pueden utilizar la combinación Mayús + Comando + 4. Pero para aquellos que buscan utilizar una grabadora de vídeo de pantalla, QuickTime Player es una gran aplicación nativa que ofrece tanto funciones de grabación de pantalla como de grabación de vídeo de pantalla.\n\nEn conclusión, tanto si buscas capturar un momento en el tiempo con una captura de pantalla como si quieres producir un tutorial completo con un grabador de vídeo en pantalla, las opciones disponibles hoy en día son amplias y variadas. La era digital ofrece herramientas para cada necesidad y, con un poco de práctica, dominar el arte de capturar la pantalla, ya sea mediante una simple captura de pantalla o una grabación de vídeo en pantalla, se convierte en algo natural.",
    "cs": "Představení komplexního nástroje pro snímání a nahrávání obrazovky\n\nOrientace ve světě snímků a záznamů obrazovky se právě stala jednodušší.

Mezi nejvyužívanější patří nástroje pro snímání obrazovky, zachycení obrazovky a nahrávání obrazovky. Ať už se snažíte zachytit prchavý okamžik na pracovní ploše, nebo usilujete o vytvoření instruktážního videa, pochopení rozdílů a použití těchto nástrojů je zásadní.\n\nPořízení snímku obrazovky\n\nSnímek obrazovky je statické zachycení obrázku, který je v daném okamžiku zobrazen na obrazovce. Je to jako pořízení fotografie obrazovky. Ať už používáte počítač Mac nebo Windows, pořízení snímku obrazovky je hračka. Pokud vás někdy zajímalo, jak pořídit snímek obrazovky, zejména na počítači Mac, stačí stisknout klávesovou kombinaci Shift + Command + 4. V případě, že chcete pořídit snímek obrazovky, stačí stisknout klávesovou kombinaci Shift + Command + 4. To vám umožní přetáhnout a vybrat část obrazovky, kterou chcete zachytit. \n\nNa druhou stranu, jiné platformy mohou mít mírně odlišné metody, ale podstata snímku obrazovky zůstává stejná - snímek aktuální obrazovky. \n\nZachycení obrazovky: V případě, že chcete zachytit snímek obrazovky, můžete použít tzv: Snímání obrazovky: více než jen statické obrázky\n\nKdyž se mluví o snímání obrazovky, často se tím myslí totéž co pořízení snímku obrazovky. V širším smyslu se však snímání obrazovky může týkat také záznamu činností na obrazovce. Zde přicházejí ke slovu funkce záznamu obrazovky a videozáznamu obrazovky.\n\nZáznamník obrazovky a videorekordér obrazovky\n\nZatímco snímek obrazovky zachycuje statický obraz obrazovky, záznamník obrazovky nebo videorekordér obrazovky zachycuje videozáznam činností na obrazovce. To je užitečné zejména při vytváření výukových programů, webinářů nebo dokonce při nahrávání hraní her. \n\nZáznamník videa na obrazovce je často vybaven dalšími funkcemi, jako je možnost začlenění hlasových komentářů nebo komentování v reálném čase. To umožňuje interaktivnější a vzdělávací zážitek pro diváka. Výstupem je video soubor, na rozdíl od statického obrazového formátu snímku obrazovky.\n\nJak pořídit snímek obrazovky a další funkce na Macu\n\nUživatelům počítačů Mac, kteří si často lámou hlavu nejen nad tím, jak pořídit snímek obrazovky, ale také nad nahráváním obrazovky, nabízí systém MacOS vestavěné nástroje.

Ganz gleich, ob Sie einen flüchtigen Moment auf Ihrem Desktop festhalten oder ein Lehrvideo produzieren möchten, es ist wichtig, die Unterschiede und Anwendungen dieser Tools zu kennen.\n\nEinen Screenshot machen\n\nEin Screenshot ist eine statische Aufnahme des Bildes, das zu einem bestimmten Zeitpunkt auf Ihrem Bildschirm angezeigt wird. Es ist so, als würde man ein Foto von seinem Bildschirm machen. Egal, ob Sie einen Mac oder einen Windows-Computer verwenden, die Aufnahme eines Screenshots ist ein Kinderspiel. Wenn Sie sich jemals gefragt haben, wie man einen Screenshot macht, insbesondere auf einem Mac, drücken Sie einfach Umschalt + Befehl + 4.

Im weiteren Sinne kann sich Screen Capture aber auch auf die Aufzeichnung von Bildschirmaktivitäten beziehen. Hier kommen die Funktionen des Bildschirmrecorders und des Bildschirmvideorecorders ins Spiel.\n\nDer Bildschirmrekorder und der Bildschirmvideorekorder\n\nWährend ein Screenshot ein Standbild Ihres Bildschirms aufnimmt, zeichnet ein Bildschirmrekorder oder Bildschirmvideorekorder Videomaterial von den Aktivitäten auf Ihrem Bildschirm auf.

Dies ermöglicht eine interaktive und lehrreiche Erfahrung für den Betrachter. Die Ausgabe ist eine Videodatei, im Gegensatz zum statischen Bildformat eines Screenshots.\n\nWie man einen Screenshot und mehr auf einem Mac macht\n\nFür Mac-Benutzer, die sich nicht nur fragen, wie man einen Screenshot macht, sondern auch, wie sie ihren Bildschirm aufzeichnen können, bietet das MacOS integrierte Werkzeuge. Wie bereits erwähnt, können Mac-Benutzer für einen Screenshot die Tastenkombination Umschalt + Befehl + 4 verwenden. Für diejenigen, die einen Bildschirmvideorecorder verwenden möchten, ist der QuickTime Player eine großartige native Anwendung, die sowohl Funktionen für die Bildschirmaufnahme als auch für die Aufnahme von Bildschirmvideos bietet.\n\nZusammenfassend lässt sich sagen, dass die Möglichkeiten, die heute zur Verfügung stehen, riesig und vielfältig sind, ganz gleich, ob Sie einen Moment mit einem Screenshot festhalten oder mit einem Bildschirmvideorecorder ein umfassendes Lernprogramm erstellen möchten. Das digitale Zeitalter bietet Tools für jeden Bedarf, und mit ein wenig Übung wird die Kunst der Bildschirmaufnahme, sei es durch einen einfachen Screenshot oder eine Bildschirmvideoaufnahme, zur zweiten Natur.",

Kõige enam kasutatavaid on ekraanipildistamise, ekraani jäädvustamise ja ekraanisalvestuse vahendid. Olenemata sellest, kas püüate jäädvustada põgusat hetke oma töölaual või kavatsete luua õppevideo, on nende vahendite erinevuste ja rakenduste mõistmine ülioluline.\n\nEkraanipildi tegemine\n\nEkraanipilt on staatiline pildi jäädvustus sellest, mis on teie ekraanil igal hetkel kuvatud. See on justkui foto tegemine teie ekraanist. Olenemata sellest, kas kasutate Mac- või Windows-arvutit, on ekraanipildi tegemine imelihtne. Kui sa kunagi mõtled, kuidas teha ekraanipilti, eriti Macil, siis vajuta lihtsalt Shift + Command + 4. See võimaldab sul lohistada ja valida pildistamiseks ekraaniosa. \n\nTeisalt võivad teistel platvormidel olla veidi teistsugused meetodid, kuid ekraanipildi olemus jääb samaks - hetkekujutis sinu praegusest ekraanist. \n\nEkraanipiltide jäädvustamine: Lisaks staatilistele piltidele\n\nKui inimesed räägivad ekraanitõmmisest, siis tihtipeale peetakse silmas sama asja kui ekraanipildi tegemine.

See on eriti kasulik õpetuste, veebiseminaride või isegi mängude salvestamiseks. \n\nEkraanivideote salvestajal on sageli lisafunktsioone, näiteks võimalus lisada häälitsusi või teha märkmeid reaalajas. See võimaldab vaatajale interaktiivsemat ja harivat kogemust.

Käytetyimpiä ovat kuvakaappaus-, kuvankaappaus- ja näytön tallennustyökalut. Yrititpä sitten tallentaa hetkellisen hetken työpöydälläsi tai tuottaa opetusvideon, näiden työkalujen erojen ja sovellusten ymmärtäminen on ratkaisevan tärkeää.\n\nKuvakaappauksen ottaminen\n\nKuvakaappaus on staattinen kuvankaappaus siitä, mitä näytölläsi näkyy tiettynä hetkenä. Se on kuin valokuvan ottaminen näytöstäsi. Kuvakaappauksen ottaminen on helppoa riippumatta siitä, käytätkö Mac- vai Windows-tietokonetta. Jos joskus mietit, miten otat kuvakaappauksen, erityisesti Mac-tietokoneessa, paina yksinkertaisesti Shift + Command + 4. Näin voit vetää ja valita osan näytöstäsi kaappausta varten. \n\nToisaalta muilla alustoilla saattaa olla hieman erilaisia menetelmiä, mutta kuvakaappauksen ydin pysyy samana - tilannekuva nykyisestä näytöstäsi. \n\nNäytönkaappaus: Staattisten kuvien lisäksi\n\nKun ihmiset puhuvat kuvankaappauksesta, he tarkoittavat usein samaa kuin kuvakaappauksen ottaminen. Laajemmassa merkityksessä kuvankaappauksella voidaan kuitenkin tarkoittaa myös näytön toimintojen tallentamista. Tällöin kuvanauhuri- ja videonauhuritoiminnot tulevat kuvaan.\n\nNäyttötallennin ja näyttövideotallennin\n\nNäyttökuva tallentaa pysäytyskuvan näytöstäsi, kun taas näytön tallennin tai näytön videotallennin tallentaa videomateriaalia näytön toiminnoista. Tämä on erityisen hyödyllistä opetusohjelmien, webinaarien tai jopa pelien tallentamisessa. \n\nRuutuvideonauhurissa on usein lisätoimintoja, kuten mahdollisuus sisällyttää äänitallenteita tai kommentoida reaaliaikaisesti. Näin katsojalle saadaan interaktiivisempi ja opettavaisempi kokemus. Tuloksena on videotiedosto, toisin kuin näyttökuvan staattisessa kuvamuodossa.\n\nKuvakaappauksen ottaminen ja muuta Macilla\n\nMac-käyttäjille, jotka usein miettivät paitsi sitä, miten ottaa kuvakaappaus, myös sitä, miten tallentaa näyttöä, MacOS tarjoaa sisäänrakennettuja työkaluja. Kuten aiemmin mainittiin, Mac-käyttäjät voivat käyttää kuvakaappaukseen yhdistelmää Shift + Command + 4. Mutta niille, jotka haluavat käyttää näytön videonauhuria, QuickTime Player on loistava natiivisovellus, joka tarjoaa sekä näytön tallennus että näytön videonauhuritoiminnot.\n\nYhteenvetona voidaan todeta, että olipa kyseessä sitten hetken vangitseminen kuvakaappauksella tai kattavan opetusohjelman tuottaminen näytön videotallentimella, nykyään käytettävissä olevat vaihtoehdot ovat laajat ja monipuoliset. Digitaalinen aikakausi tarjoaa työkaluja jokaiseen tarpeeseen, ja pienellä harjoittelulla näytön tallentamisen taidon hallitsemisesta tulee itsestäänselvyys, olipa kyse sitten yksinkertaisesta kuvakaappauksesta tai näytön videotallenteesta.",

Questo versatile strumento è la soluzione unica per tutte le vostre esigenze di cattura e registrazione dello schermo, progettato con una vasta gamma di funzioni su misura per l'odierna era digitale.\n\n**FUNZIONI DI CATTURA DELLO SCHERMO**\n\nLa funzione di screenshot consente di catturare senza sforzo un'intera pagina web, una sezione designata o solo l'area attualmente visibile.\n\n⭐ Dopo aver catturato una schermata, è possibile passare immediatamente all'editing e salvare in formati come PDF, JPEG e PNG.\n\nLa memorizzazione rapida garantisce l'assenza di ritardi e la modalità offline consente di catturare le schermate senza preoccuparsi dei dati.\n\n❗ Migliorate le vostre schermate con potenti strumenti di editing:\n   👉 Facile condivisione su Google Drive o tramite link.\n   👉 Copia istantanea delle catture di schermo negli appunti.\n   👉 Ridimensionate, ritagliate e personalizzate le vostre catture.\n   👉 Annotazioni con varie forme, perfette per evidenziare.\n   👉 Inserite e modificate il testo per trasmettere di più con il vostro screenshot.\n   👉 Sottolineate i punti vitali con la funzione di evidenziazione.\n\n**CARATTERISTICHE DEL REGISTRATORE DI SCHERMO**\n\n⭐ Questo strumento permette di immergersi nel mondo della registrazione dello schermo senza soluzione di continuità, consentendo di catturare video e di ottenere un link di condivisione immediato, rendendo le collaborazioni un gioco da ragazzi.\n\nDalle fasi di verifica dei prodotti ai cicli di feedback, il registratore di schermate vi garantisce di rimanere sincronizzati con il vostro team, grazie alla funzione video async.\n\n❗ Le funzionalità del registratore dello schermo includono:\n   👉 Registrazione del desktop, di una particolare scheda del browser o del feed della fotocamera.\n   👉 Integrare le vostre reazioni nella registrazione dello schermo incorporando la vostra webcam.\n   👉 Aggiungete un tocco personale con i voiceover tramite l'opzione microfono.\n   👉 Archiviate le vostre registrazioni in locale o su Google Drive.\n   👉 Possibilità di scegliere tra i formati di download WebM o MP4.\n   👉 Link di condivisione istantanea dopo ogni sessione di registrazione.\n\nInsomma, per chi è alla ricerca di un robusto strumento di screenshot e screen recorder, questa estensione di Chrome è la risposta, con una miriade di opzioni per tutti i vostri desideri di cattura e registrazione.\n\nNell'era digitale in continua evoluzione, si è assistito a un aumento degli strumenti e delle tecniche per documentare e condividere ciò che vediamo sui nostri schermi. Tra i più utilizzati ci sono gli strumenti di screenshot, cattura e registrazione dello schermo. Sia che stiate cercando di catturare un momento fugace sul vostro desktop o che vogliate produrre un video didattico, è fondamentale comprendere le differenze e le applicazioni di questi strumenti.\n\nFare uno screenshot\n\nUno screenshot è un'immagine statica di ciò che viene visualizzato sullo schermo in un determinato momento. È come scattare una foto dello schermo. Sia che si utilizzi un computer Mac o Windows, fare uno screenshot è un gioco da ragazzi. Se vi chiedete come si fa a fare uno screenshot, in particolare su un Mac, basta premere Maiusc + Comando + 4. Questo vi permette di trascinare e selezionare una schermata. In questo modo è possibile trascinare e selezionare una porzione di schermo da catturare. \n\nD'altra parte, altre piattaforme possono avere metodi leggermente diversi, ma l'essenza di uno screenshot rimane coerente: un'istantanea della schermata corrente. \n\nCattura dello schermo: Oltre le immagini statiche\n\nQuando si parla di cattura dello schermo, spesso si intende la stessa cosa che fare uno screenshot. Tuttavia, in senso più ampio, la cattura dello schermo può anche riferirsi alla registrazione delle attività dello schermo. È qui che entrano in gioco le funzionalità di screen recorder e screen video recorder.\n\nIl registratore e il videoregistratore dello schermo\n\nMentre uno screenshot cattura un'immagine fissa dello schermo, un registratore di schermo o un videoregistratore cattura le riprese video delle attività sullo schermo. Questo è particolarmente utile per creare tutorial, webinar o anche per registrare il gameplay. \n\nUn videoregistratore per schermo è spesso dotato di funzionalità aggiuntive, come la possibilità di incorporare voci fuori campo o annotazioni in tempo reale. Ciò consente un'esperienza più interattiva ed educativa per lo spettatore. L'output è un file video, rispetto al formato immagine statico di uno screenshot.\n\nCome fare screenshot e molto altro su Mac\n\nPer gli utenti Mac che spesso si chiedono non solo come fare uno screenshot ma anche come registrare lo schermo, il sistema operativo MacOS offre strumenti integrati. Come accennato in precedenza, per fare uno screenshot gli utenti Mac possono usare la combinazione Maiusc + Comando + 4. Per coloro che desiderano utilizzare un registratore video dello schermo, QuickTime Player è un'ottima applicazione nativa che offre funzionalità di registrazione e registrazione video dello schermo.\n\nIn conclusione, sia che vogliate catturare un momento nel tempo con uno screenshot o che vogliate produrre un tutorial completo con un registratore video dello schermo, le opzioni disponibili oggi sono vaste e varie. L'era digitale offre strumenti per ogni esigenza e, con un po' di pratica, padroneggiare l'arte di catturare lo schermo, che si tratti di un semplice screenshot o di una registrazione video, diventa una seconda natura.",

Taip galėsite vilkti ir pasirinkti ekrano dalį, kurią reikia užfiksuoti. \n\nKita vertus, kitose platformose gali būti taikomi šiek tiek kitokie metodai, tačiau ekrano nuotraukos esmė išlieka vienoda - tai dabartinio ekrano momentinė nuotrauka. \n\nEkrano fiksavimas: Skaitmeninis vaizdas: daugiau nei statiniai vaizdai\n\nKai žmonės kalba apie ekrano fiksavimą, jie dažnai turi omenyje tą patį, ką ir ekrano nuotraukos darymas. Tačiau platesne prasme ekrano fiksavimas taip pat gali reikšti veiklos ekrane įrašymą. Čia praverčia ekrano įrašymo ir ekrano vaizdo įrašymo funkcijos.\n\nEkrano diktofonas ir ekrano vaizdo įrašymo įrenginys\n\nEkrano nuotrauka užfiksuoja nejudantį ekrano vaizdą, o ekrano įrašymo įrenginys arba ekrano vaizdo įrašymo įrenginys fiksuoja ekrane vykdomos veiklos vaizdo įrašus. Tai ypač naudinga kuriant vadovėlius, internetinius seminarus ar net įrašant žaidimo procesą. \n\nEkrano vaizdo įrašymo įrenginys dažnai turi papildomų funkcijų, pavyzdžiui, galimybę įrašyti įgarsinimą arba komentarus realiuoju laiku. Tai leidžia žiūrovui suteikti daugiau interaktyvumo ir edukacinės patirties. Išvesties rezultatas yra vaizdo failas, o ne statinio vaizdo formato ekrano nuotrauka.\n\nKaip \"Mac\" kompiuteriu daryti ekrano nuotraukas ir dar daugiau\n\n\"Mac\" naudotojams, kuriems dažnai kyla klausimas ne tik apie tai, kaip padaryti ekrano nuotrauką, bet ir apie ekrano įrašymą, \"MacOS\" siūlo integruotus įrankius. Kaip jau minėta, ekrano nuotraukai daryti \"Mac\" naudotojai gali naudoti Shift + Command + 4 kombinaciją. Tačiau tiems, kurie nori naudoti ekrano vaizdo įrašymo įrenginį, \"QuickTime Player\" yra puiki vietinė programa, kuri siūlo ir ekrano įrašymo, ir ekrano vaizdo įrašymo funkcijas.\n\nApibendrinant galima pasakyti, kad nesvarbu, ar norite užfiksuoti akimirką naudodami ekrano nuotrauką, ar norite sukurti išsamią pamoką naudodami ekrano vaizdo įrašymo įrenginį, šiandien turimos galimybės yra labai plačios ir įvairios. Skaitmeniniame amžiuje siūlomi įrankiai kiekvienam poreikiui, o šiek tiek pasipraktikavus, ekrano fiksavimo meno įvaldymas, nesvarbu, ar tai būtų paprasta ekrano nuotrauka, ar ekrano vaizdo įrašymas, tampa antraeiliu dalyku.",

Vieni no visvairāk izmantotajiem ir ekrānšāviņi, ekrāna uztveršanas un ekrāna ierakstīšanas rīki. Neatkarīgi no tā, vai mēģināt iemūžināt mirklīgu mirkli savā darbvirsmā vai cenšaties izveidot mācību videoklipu, izprast šo rīku atšķirības un pielietojumu ir ļoti svarīgi.\n\nEkrānšāviņa uzņemšana\n\nEkrānšāviņš ir statisks attēls, kas fiksē ekrānā redzamo jebkurā brīdī. Tā ir kā ekrāna fotoattēla uzņemšana. Neatkarīgi no tā, vai izmantojat Mac vai Windows datoru, ekrānšāviņa uzņemšana ir vienkārša. Ja kādreiz aizdomājāties, kā uzņemt ekrānšāviņu, jo īpaši ekrānšāviņu Mac datorā, vienkārši nospiediet Shift + Command + 4. Tas ļauj vilkt un atlasīt ekrāna daļu, lai to uzņemtu. \n\nNo otras puses, citās platformās var būt nedaudz atšķirīgas metodes, taču ekrānšāviņa būtība paliek nemainīga - jūsu pašreizējā ekrāna momentuzņēmums. \n\nEkrāna uzņemšana: Papildus statiskiem attēliem\n\nKad cilvēki runā par ekrāna uzņemšanu, viņi bieži vien ar to saprot ekrānšāviņa uzņemšanu. Tomēr plašākā nozīmē ekrāna uzņemšana var attiekties arī uz ekrāna darbību ierakstīšanu. Šajā gadījumā tiek izmantotas ekrānreģistratora un ekrānvideoieraksta funkcijas.\n\nEkrānreģistrators un ekrānvideo ierakstītājs\n\nJa ekrānšāviņš fiksē ekrāna nekustīgu attēlu, tad ekrānreģistrators vai ekrāna videoieraksta ierakstītājs fiksē ekrānā notiekošo darbību videoierakstus. Tas ir īpaši noderīgi, lai veidotu pamācības, tīmekļa seminārus vai pat ierakstītu spēles gaitu. \n\nEkrāna videoreģistratoram bieži vien ir pievienotas papildu funkcijas, piemēram, iespēja iekļaut balss ierakstus vai anotēt reāllaikā. Tas ļauj skatītājam gūt interaktīvāku un izglītojošāku pieredzi. Izvades rezultāts ir video fails, nevis statisks attēla formāts, kāds ir ekrānšāviņa attēliem.\n\nKā uz Mac veikt ekrānšāviņu un citas darbības\n\nMac lietotājiem, kuri bieži vien domā ne tikai par to, kā uzņemt ekrānšāviņu, bet arī par ekrāna ierakstīšanu, MacOS piedāvā iebūvētos rīkus. Kā minēts iepriekš, ekrānšāviņa uzņemšanai Mac lietotāji var izmantot kombināciju Shift + Command + 4. Bet tiem, kas vēlas izmantot ekrāna video ierakstīšanas rīku, QuickTime Player ir lieliska vietējā programma, kas piedāvā gan ekrāna ierakstīšanas, gan ekrāna video ierakstīšanas funkcijas.\n\nNobeigumā var secināt, ka neatkarīgi no tā, vai vēlaties iemūžināt mirkli laikā ar ekrānšāviņu vai vēlaties izveidot visaptverošu pamācību ar ekrāna videoreģistratoru, šodien pieejamās iespējas ir plašas un daudzveidīgas. Digitālais laikmets piedāvā rīkus jebkurai vajadzībai, un, nedaudz praktizējoties, ekrāna iemūžināšanas mākslas apgūšana, vai nu izmantojot vienkāršu ekrānšāviņu, vai ekrāna videoierakstu, kļūst par otro dabu.",

Of je nu een vluchtig moment op je bureaublad wilt vastleggen of een instructievideo wilt maken, het is van cruciaal belang om de verschillen en toepassingen van deze tools te begrijpen.\n\nEen schermafbeelding maken\n\nEen screenshot is een statische afbeelding van wat er op een bepaald moment op je scherm wordt weergegeven. Het is alsof je een foto van je scherm maakt. Of je nu een Mac of een Windows computer gebruikt, een schermafbeelding maken is een fluitje van een cent. Als je je ooit afvraagt hoe je een schermafbeelding maakt, vooral op een Mac, dan druk je gewoon op Shift + Command + 4.

In bredere zin kan screen capture echter ook verwijzen naar het opnemen van schermactiviteiten. Dit is waar de screen recorder en screen video recorder functionaliteiten om de hoek komen kijken.\n\nDe schermrecorder en schermvideorecorder\n\nTerwijl een screenshot een stilstaand beeld van je scherm vastlegt, legt een schermrecorder of schermvideorecorder videobeelden vast van de activiteiten op je scherm. Dit is vooral handig voor het maken van tutorials, webinars of zelfs het opnemen van gameplay. \n\nEen schermvideorecorder wordt vaak geleverd met extra functionaliteiten zoals de optie om voice-overs in te voegen of annotaties te maken in real-time. Dit zorgt voor een meer interactieve en educatieve ervaring voor de kijker. De output is een videobestand, in tegenstelling tot het statische beeldformaat van een screenshot.\n\nHoe maak je een schermafbeelding en meer op een Mac?\n\nMac-gebruikers die zich vaak niet alleen afvragen hoe ze een schermafbeelding moeten maken, maar ook hoe ze hun scherm moeten opnemen, hebben in het MacOS ingebouwde hulpmiddelen. Zoals eerder vermeld, kunnen Mac-gebruikers voor een schermafbeelding de combinatie Shift + Command + 4 gebruiken.

É aqui que entram em jogo as funcionalidades do gravador de ecrã e do gravador de vídeo de ecrã.\n\nO gravador de ecrã e o gravador de vídeo de ecrã\n\nEnquanto uma captura de ecrã capta uma imagem fixa do seu ecrã, um gravador de ecrã ou um gravador de vídeo de ecrã capta imagens de vídeo das actividades no seu ecrã. Isto é particularmente útil para criar tutoriais, webinars ou mesmo para gravar jogos. \n\nUm gravador de vídeo de ecrã vem frequentemente com funcionalidades adicionais, como a opção de incorporar locuções ou anotações em tempo real. Isto permite uma experiência mais interactiva e educativa para o espetador. O resultado é um ficheiro de vídeo, por oposição ao formato de imagem estática de uma captura de ecrã.\n\nComo tirar uma captura de ecrã e muito mais no Mac\n\nPara os utilizadores de Mac que muitas vezes se interrogam não só sobre como tirar uma captura de ecrã, mas também sobre como gravar o seu ecrã, o MacOS oferece ferramentas incorporadas. Como mencionado anteriormente, os utilizadores de Mac podem utilizar a combinação Shift + Command + 4 para tirar uma captura de ecrã. Mas para aqueles que pretendem utilizar um gravador de vídeo de ecrã, o QuickTime Player é uma excelente aplicação nativa que oferece funcionalidades de gravação de ecrã e de vídeo de ecrã.\n\nEm conclusão, quer pretenda captar um momento com uma captura de ecrã ou produzir um tutorial completo com um gravador de vídeo de ecrã, as opções disponíveis atualmente são vastas e variadas. A era digital oferece ferramentas para todas as necessidades e, com um pouco de prática, dominar a arte de capturar o seu ecrã, seja através de uma simples captura de ecrã ou de uma gravação de vídeo de ecrã, torna-se uma segunda natureza.",

Či už sa snažíte zachytiť prchavý okamih na pracovnej ploche, alebo sa snažíte vytvoriť inštruktážne video, pochopenie rozdielov a použitia týchto nástrojov je veľmi dôležité.\n\nSnímanie obrazovky\n\nSnímka obrazovky je statický obrazový záznam toho, čo je v danom okamihu zobrazené na obrazovke. Je to ako zhotovenie fotografie obrazovky. Bez ohľadu na to, či používate počítač Mac alebo Windows, zhotovenie snímky obrazovky je hračka. Ak ste niekedy rozmýšľali, ako urobiť snímku obrazovky, najmä na počítači Mac, stačí stlačiť klávesovú skratku Shift + Command + 4. To vám umožní potiahnuť a vybrať časť obrazovky na zachytenie. \n\nNa druhej strane, iné platformy môžu mať trochu odlišné metódy, ale podstata snímky obrazovky zostáva rovnaká - snímka aktuálnej obrazovky. \n\nSnímanie obrazovky: Okrem statických obrázkov\n\nKeď sa ľudia zmieňujú o snímaní obrazovky, často majú na mysli to isté ako zhotovenie snímky obrazovky. V širšom zmysle sa však snímanie obrazovky môže vzťahovať aj na zaznamenávanie činností na obrazovke.

To je užitočné najmä pri vytváraní výukových programov, webových seminárov alebo dokonca pri nahrávaní hrania hier. \n\nVideorekordér obrazovky sa často dodáva s ďalšími funkciami, ako je možnosť zahrnúť hlasové komentáre alebo komentáre v reálnom čase. To umožňuje interaktívnejší a vzdelávací zážitok pre diváka. Výstupom je videosúbor na rozdiel od statického obrazového formátu snímky obrazovky.\n\nAko robiť snímky obrazovky a ďalšie funkcie na počítači Mac\n\nPoužívateľom počítačov Mac, ktorí často rozmýšľajú nielen o tom, ako urobiť snímku obrazovky, ale aj o nahrávaní obrazovky, ponúka operačný systém MacOS vstavané nástroje. Ako sme už spomenuli, na vytvorenie snímky obrazovky môžu používatelia počítačov Mac použiť kombináciu klávesov Shift + Command + 4. Ale pre tých, ktorí chcú využiť nahrávač videa obrazovky, je skvelou natívnou aplikáciou QuickTime Player, ktorý ponúka funkcie nahrávania obrazovky aj nahrávania videa obrazovky.\n\nZáverom možno povedať, že či už chcete zachytiť okamih pomocou snímky obrazovky, alebo chcete vytvoriť komplexný výukový program pomocou videorekordéra obrazovky, možnosti, ktoré sú dnes k dispozícii, sú široké a rozmanité. Digitálny vek ponúka nástroje pre každú potrebu a s trochou praxe sa ovládanie umenia zachytávania obrazovky, či už prostredníctvom jednoduchého snímku obrazovky alebo videozáznamu obrazovky, stane druhou prirodzenosťou.",

Med najpogosteje uporabljenimi so orodja za izdelavo zaslonskih slik, zajem zaslona in snemanje zaslona. Ne glede na to, ali želite ujeti bežni trenutek na namizju ali pa si prizadevate ustvariti video z navodili, je razumevanje razlik in uporabe teh orodij ključnega pomena.\n\nUstvarjanje posnetka zaslona\n\nPosnetek zaslona je statična slika, ki zajame tisto, kar je v danem trenutku prikazano na zaslonu. To je kot fotografiranje zaslona. Ne glede na to, ali uporabljate računalnik Mac ali Windows, je ustvarjanje posnetka zaslona preprosto. Če se kdaj sprašujete, kako narediti posnetek zaslona, zlasti v računalniku Mac, preprosto pritisnite Shift + Command + 4. Tako lahko povlečete in izberete del zaslona, ki ga želite zajeti. \n\nPo drugi strani imajo druge platforme morda nekoliko drugačne metode, vendar bistvo posnetka zaslona ostaja enako - posnetek trenutnega zaslona. \n\nZajem zaslona: Slika: več kot le statične slike\n\nKo ljudje govorijo o zajemu zaslona, imajo pogosto v mislih isto kot zajem zaslona. Vendar se lahko zajem zaslona v širšem smislu nanaša tudi na snemanje dejavnosti na zaslonu. Tu pridejo v poštev funkcije snemalnika zaslona in snemalnika videoposnetkov zaslona.\n\nSnemalnik zaslona in snemalnik zaslonskega videa\n\nMedtem ko posnetek zaslona zajame mirujočo sliko zaslona, snemalnik zaslona ali videorekorder zaslona zajame videoposnetek dejavnosti na zaslonu. To je še posebej uporabno za ustvarjanje učnih gradiv, spletnih seminarjev ali celo snemanje igranja iger. \n\nZaslonski videorekorder ima pogosto dodatne funkcije, kot je možnost vključevanja glasovnih vložkov ali komentiranja v realnem času. To omogoča bolj interaktivno in izobraževalno izkušnjo za gledalca. Rezultat je video datoteka v nasprotju s statičnim slikovnim formatom posnetka zaslona.\n\nKako narediti posnetek zaslona in več na Macu\n\nUporabnikom računalnikov Mac, ki se pogosto sprašujejo ne le o tem, kako narediti posnetek zaslona, temveč tudi o snemanju zaslona, MacOS ponuja vgrajena orodja. Kot smo že omenili, lahko uporabniki Maca za izdelavo zaslonske slike uporabijo kombinacijo Shift + Command + 4. Za tiste, ki želijo uporabiti snemalnik zaslonskega videa, pa je QuickTime Player odlična domača aplikacija, ki ponuja funkcije snemanja zaslona in snemanja zaslonskega videa.\n\nČe želite ujeti trenutek v času s posnetkom zaslona ali pripraviti izčrpno navodilo s snemalnikom zaslonskega videa, so možnosti, ki so danes na voljo, velike in raznolike. Digitalna doba ponuja orodja za vse potrebe in z nekaj vaje bo obvladovanje umetnosti zajemanja zaslona, bodisi s preprostim posnetkom zaslona ali snemanjem zaslonskega videoposnetka, postalo druga narava.",

Men i en bredare mening kan skärmdump också hänvisa till inspelning av skärmaktiviteter. Det är här funktionerna för skärminspelare och skärmvideoinspelare kommer in i bilden.\n\nSkärminspelaren och skärminspelaren\n\nMedan en skärmdump tar en stillbild av din skärm, tar en skärminspelare eller skärmvideoinspelare videofilmer av aktiviteterna på din skärm. Detta är särskilt användbart för att skapa handledning, webbseminarier eller till och med spela in spel. \n\nEn skärminspelare har ofta extra funktioner, t.ex. möjlighet att lägga till berättarröst eller kommentera i realtid. Detta möjliggör en mer interaktiv och pedagogisk upplevelse för tittaren. Utgången är en videofil, i motsats till det statiska bildformatet för en skärmdump.\n\nHur man tar en skärmdump och mer på en Mac\n\nFör Mac-användare som ofta undrar inte bara hur man tar en skärmdump utan också hur man spelar in sin skärm, erbjuder MacOS inbyggda verktyg. Som tidigare nämnts kan Mac-användare använda Shift + Command + 4-kombinationen för en skärmdump. Men för dem som vill använda en skärmvideoinspelare är QuickTime Player ett bra inbyggt program som erbjuder både skärminspelning och skärmvideoinspelningsfunktioner.\n\nSammanfattningsvis, oavsett om du vill fånga ett ögonblick med en skärmdump eller producera en omfattande handledning med en skärminspelare, är de alternativ som finns idag stora och varierade. Den digitala tidsåldern erbjuder verktyg för alla behov, och med lite övning blir det en självklarhet att behärska konsten att fånga din skärm, vare sig det är genom en enkel skärmdump eller en videoinspelning.",

Bu çok yönlü araç, günümüzün dijital çağına uygun çok çeşitli özelliklerle tasarlanmış, tüm ekran yakalama ve ekran kayıt ihtiyaçlarınız için tek durak çözümünüzdür.\n\n**EKRAN YAKALAMA ÖZELLİKLERİ**\n\nEkran görüntüsü işlevi, web sayfasının tamamını, belirlenmiş bir bölümü veya yalnızca o anda görünen alanı zahmetsizce yakalamanızı sağlar.\n\nEkran görüntüsü aldıktan sonra hemen düzenlemeye geçebilir, ardından PDF, JPEG ve PNG gibi formatlarda kaydedebilirsiniz.\n\nHızlı depolama, gecikme olmamasını sağlar ve çevrimdışı mod, herhangi bir veri endişesi olmadan ekran yakalama sunar.\n\nGüçlü düzenleme araçlarıyla ekran görüntülerinizi geliştirin:\n- Google Drive'da veya bir bağlantı aracılığıyla kolay paylaşım.\n- Ekran görüntülerinizi anında panonuza kopyalayın.\n- Yakalamalarınızı yeniden boyutlandırın, kırpın ve uyarlayın.\n- Vurgulama için mükemmel olan çeşitli şekillere sahip ek açıklamalar.\n- Ekran görüntünüzle daha fazlasını iletmek için metin ekleyin ve değiştirin.\n- Vurgulama özelliği ile önemli noktaları vurgulayın.\n\n**EKRAN KAYDEDICI ÖZELLIKLERI**\n\nBu araçla ekran kaydının kusursuz dünyasına dalın, videoları yakalamanıza ve anında bir paylaşım bağlantısı almanıza olanak tanıyarak işbirliklerini çocuk oyuncağı haline getirin.\n\nEkran kaydedici, async video özelliği sayesinde ürün incelemelerinden geri bildirim turlarına kadar ekibinizle senkronize kalmanızı sağlar.\n\nEkran kaydedici özellikleri şunları içerir:\n- Masaüstünüzü, belirli bir tarayıcı sekmesini veya kamera akışınızı kaydedin.\n- Web kameranızı yerleştirerek tepkilerinizi ekran kaydına entegre edin.\n- Mikrofon seçeneğini kullanarak seslendirmelerle kişisel bir dokunuş ekleyin.\n- Kayıtlarınızı yerel olarak veya Google Drive'da saklayın.\n- WebM veya MP4 indirme formatlarından birini seçin.\n- Her kayıt oturumundan sonra anında paylaşım bağlantıları.\n\nÖzetle, sağlam bir ekran görüntüsü ve ekran kaydedici aracı arayanlar için, tüm yakalama ve kayıt arzularınız için sayısız seçenek barındıran bu Chrome uzantısı cevaptır.\n\nSürekli gelişen dijital çağda, ekranlarımızda gördüklerimizi belgelemek ve paylaşmak için kullanılan araç ve tekniklerde bir artış oldu. En çok kullanılanlar arasında ekran görüntüsü, ekran yakalama ve ekran kaydedici araçları yer alıyor. İster masaüstünüzdeki kısa bir anı yakalamaya çalışıyor olun, ister eğitici bir video hazırlamayı hedefliyor olun, bu araçların farklarını ve uygulamalarını anlamak çok önemlidir.\n\nEkran Görüntüsü Alma\n\nEkran görüntüsü, herhangi bir anda ekranınızda görüntülenen şeyin statik bir görüntü yakalamasıdır. Ekranınızın fotoğrafını çekmek gibidir. İster Mac ister Windows bilgisayar kullanıyor olun, ekran görüntüsü almak çocuk oyuncağıdır. Ekran görüntüsünün nasıl alınacağını merak ediyorsanız, özellikle de Mac ekran görüntüsü alıyorsanız, Shift + Command + 4 tuşlarına basmanız yeterlidir. Bu, ekranınızın bir bölümünü yakalamak için sürüklemenize ve seçmenize olanak tanır. \n\nÖte yandan, diğer platformların biraz farklı yöntemleri olabilir, ancak bir ekran görüntüsünün özü tutarlı kalır - mevcut ekranınızın anlık görüntüsü. \n\nEkran Yakalama: Statik Görüntülerin Ötesinde\n\nİnsanlar ekran yakalamadan bahsettiklerinde, genellikle ekran görüntüsü almakla aynı şeyi kastederler. Ancak daha geniş anlamda ekran yakalama, ekran etkinliklerinin kaydedilmesi anlamına da gelebilir. İşte bu noktada ekran kaydedici ve ekran video kaydedici işlevleri devreye girer.\n\nEkran Kaydedici ve Ekran Video Kaydedici\n\nBir ekran görüntüsü ekranınızın hareketsiz bir görüntüsünü yakalarken, bir ekran kaydedici veya ekran video kaydedici ekranınızdaki etkinliklerin video görüntülerini yakalar. Bu özellikle eğitimler, web seminerleri oluşturmak ve hatta oyun kaydetmek için kullanışlıdır. \n\nBir ekran video kaydedici genellikle seslendirme veya gerçek zamanlı açıklama ekleme seçeneği gibi ek işlevlerle birlikte gelir. Bu, izleyici için daha etkileşimli ve eğitici bir deneyim sağlar. Çıktı, ekran görüntüsünün statik görüntü formatının aksine bir video dosyasıdır.\n\nMac'te Ekran Görüntüsü Alma ve Daha Fazlası\n\nSadece ekran görüntüsünün nasıl alınacağını değil, aynı zamanda ekranlarını kaydetmeyi de merak eden Mac kullanıcıları için MacOS yerleşik araçlar sunuyor. Daha önce de belirtildiği gibi, Mac kullanıcıları ekran görüntüsü almak için Shift + Command + 4 kombinasyonunu kullanabilirler.
