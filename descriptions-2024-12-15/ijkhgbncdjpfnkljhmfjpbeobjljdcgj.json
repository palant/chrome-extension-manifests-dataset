NEWS FLASH: You are not alone!  At any given moment, hundreds (or hundreds of thousands) of like-minded people are viewing the exact same page that you are.  Bonfires enables you to connect with them and chat about wherever your passions have taken you.\n\nBuilding Community Around Content  💃🏾🕺🏾 \n\nTalk directly with people who are reading the same article, looking at the same social profile, watching the same TV show, listening to the same music, etc. as you.  Wherever your internet exploration takes you, the Bonfires app is right there with you. Come join the global conversation taking place about the things that matter most to you.\n\nToken-Gated Access  🔐🖼\n\nWe ❤️ NFTs!!!

Submit your favorite NFT collection here: https://forms.gle/n2YNU2cMbEwu5dZ68.  We especially love inclusive NFT communities! 🌈✊🏾❤️\n\nNote: Bonfires is currently in early-alpha release.  It is ugly and has all sorts of bugs (...bugly?). 🐞🐛🐜  Really, it's more of a *dys*functional prototype than anything else.  We are desperate for your feedback to help make it awesome!  👍🏾👍🏾👍🏾"
