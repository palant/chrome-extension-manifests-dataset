This allows you to watch that Youtube video for work or write that social media post without being distracted by the homepage.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\n🙋 IS MY DATA KEPT SAFE?\n\n🔒 Focus Block is designed to protect your privacy. \n\nFocus Block only uses the current URL in the address bar so it know when to block a website and the last time it was turned off so it knows when to resume blocking again. All of this data lives in your chrome account and is never transferred outside.\n\nNote: You may be asked to share browsing history upon installation but this permission is only used for checking the current URL.\n\n📵 No browsing history is stored anywhere.\n📵 No website data is stored anywhere.\n\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nFOCUS on your work. BLOCK all distractions.\n\nHappy focusing!"
