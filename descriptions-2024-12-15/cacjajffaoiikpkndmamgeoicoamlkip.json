NECESSARY resources are super popular and used across the industry by most successful salons. 🤩\n\n2. RECOMMENDED resources are the best choices (as of today) for their own respective use cases. 🔥\n\n3. FREE BOOKS & GIFTS are amazing stuff that I've found through talking with other hairstylists and my experience in the industry. 🎁\n\nHope you find this helpful and feel free to contact me for anything 😊"
