From then on, each tab you try to open up will immediately close. \n\nThe unique exception to this is music tabs. Lots of people work with music, and that's great! So, if you open a music tab, it will not be counted in those 5 tabs. Support is for most music platforms but not for Youtube. Youtube does count as an open tab.\n\n\nTo install it click on the \"Add to Chrome\" button in the Chrome Web Store and once installed, click on the app icon on the side of the browser navigation to activate it. Once the green ON tag is displayed on top of the bar icon, you're ready to go. Click it again to turn it off. We provide the option to turn it off quickly. However, it would be best if you did not use that at all - unless **FILL WITH A VERY IMPORTANT CONDITION**  happens.\n\n\n[Shortcuts section]\n\nWe have also found out people think twice before opening a new tab. Since most people open up tabs by using CTRL+T (in Windows) or CMD+T (in Mac), one beautiful new shortcut to learn is CTRL + K or CTRL + E (in Windows) and CMD + K or CMD + E (in Mac). \n\nCTRL+W (in windows) or CMD + W (in Mac) is your new friend.\n\n\n\nHelp Section\n\nIf you care about your productivity (or productivity in general) check my other extensions. \n\nFor any problems, bug(s), feature requests, etc. send an email to isaac [at] mammbo [dot] com."
