It shows the official logo (favicon) of the sender's organization alongside the email message. \n\nFor instance, if you receive an email from larry@google.com, the Gmail extension will add a logo of the Google website next to the message so you can immediately identify the sender in the email list.\n\nThe Gmail Chrome extension uses the Google S2 service for generating the website's favicon while the Gmail messages are parsed with the Inbox SDK framework. All processing is done locally in your browser and no Gmail data is ever shared or uploaded anywhere.\n\nThe add-on is open source and the code is available on Github. Based on the Gmail Sender Icons extension by Amit Agarwal with additional support for all TLDs. Source code is available at https://github.com/gregbradley/gmail-icons"
