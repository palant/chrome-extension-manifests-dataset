That's why we've created Aibrane! 🧠\n\nA simple, lightweight Chrome extension that harnesses the power of AI from any input on any website 🌐. Just type /ai: write a tweet about my app; and within seconds, you'll get a response 🎉.\n\nInstead of just providing the AI, we're using the MagicChat.ai API 🪄, allowing you to store some info that can be searched before we ask AI your query. For example:\n\nIf you want to write a tweet about your app, you'd typically have to describe it to the AI. But with Aibrane, save the info to your MagicChat.ai brain 🧠, and just say /ai: write a tweet about [your app name] 🐦; Aibrane will first check for any relevant info, and if available, we'll give it to the AI.\n\nGive the add-on a try now! We guarantee a boost in productivity 🚀🎯."
